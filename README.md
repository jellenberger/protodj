# Protodj

This is a one-file minimal Django setup. I use it to run experimental stuff in a familiar environment on my local machine.

It's based on [syntarsus/minimal-django](https://github.com/syntarsus/minimal-django), but has templating and static file support added. It also includes a base template that loads the venerable JQuery and Bootstrap.

No users. No db. It isn't secure. Run it with `python app.py runserver`.
